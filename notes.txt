SOULSBOURNE RESPEC FINDER

-------------------------

Aims of the program:
1. Find a suitable build given weapon type, progress in the game, starting class, level and build focus choice (STR, DEX etc.)
2. Simple UI
3. Create an algorithm to decide which stuff to dump into ????

------------------------

Algorithm:
1. Some sort of distribution of the stats according to how important they are ranked:
    i. assign a number to each one based on weapon style, level and build focus choice
        I. RATIOS, based off scaling of the item
            a. then uniform distribution for the rest (5/8 of total points go to the important traits)
        II. for float division results round then give as an extra point to something.
2. starting class affects the base template of what the user is aiming for.
3. Level obviously affects number of skill points that can be dispensed.
4. place in game - affect what kind of elemental damage to recommend (maybe recommend a specific weapon)
5. weapon type distribution slightly.
6. take into consideration the different weapons starting attribute obviously
    i. maybe make something to aim for future weapons

----------------------------

Objects:
1. database_handler
    i. will access the database and return data from it for use in calculations
2. HTML page accesser
    i. will acess and edit html inputs and return data from them to use for calculations
3. respec generator
    i. Handles all maths and logic for the repec, returns the respec to be output by the html page accesser
